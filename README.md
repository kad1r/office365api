Get emails from Office365 or Exchange via Outlook Rest API

- You can read Outlook Rest Api documentation from here -> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/rest/get-started
- If you don't want to store passwords you need to register your application to get client_id and etc from Azure Active Directory -> https://aad.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps
- App Registrations > New Registration and after that go in the registration and click Certificates and Secrets. You can create secret key from that page.
